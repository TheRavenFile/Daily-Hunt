Lazarus Group had chosen their next target: IOHK Project
========================================================
The group had freshly registered a new domain imitating IOHK Project

Domain: assessiohq.com 
Email: kathryndavies384@gmail.com
Date: 26th February 2025

ðŸ“ŒThe domain is hosted in the same IP where Phishing Domain of bybit-assessment.com was previously hosted; which was part of for $1.5B heist
ðŸ“ŒIP is previously associated with Metasploit, hence chance of using the tool by the group is high
ðŸ“ŒIn both cases, the group had made use of Domain Registrar: UKRNAMES (Center of Ukrainian Internet Names).
ðŸ“ŒThe same registrar was being used in Fake Job Campaign by Lazarus in Janruary 2025
ðŸ“ŒLazarus Group using the names of popular Blockchain Project related people such as Founders, Analyst etc to register fake domains.
ðŸ“ŒTrevor Greer (ByBit Phishing) and Kathryn Davies (IOHK Phishing) are such examples
ðŸ“Œ"Assess" is a repeated keyword used by Lazarus Group to register their Phishing Domains
ðŸ“ŒThe IP also inhouses cryptocurrency mixers like:-
